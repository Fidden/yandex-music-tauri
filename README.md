# Yandex.Music Tauri - ⚠️Unofficial⚠️

This project was created in order to sharpen my skills in VUE, and yes, the desktop client was garbage. It was fun to do
because I looked at my previous attempt and realized how stupid I was. I hope that in a few years I will look at this
repository again and think about the same thing.
